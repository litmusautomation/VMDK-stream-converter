While adding support for VMWare ESX/vSphere to the Image Factory project
we discovered that we needed to support the "stream-optimized" variant
of VMDK.

This format is useful if you are attempting to import virtual machines
into ESX using the vSphere SOAP API and HTTP POST uploads of image files.
(In which case, it is required.)

It is also the must for creating OVF/OVA virtual appliances.
